# Wind Energy Converter Energy Output Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict the energy output of wind energy converters using machine learning models. Two datasets are used for this purpose: one from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and another uploaded separately.

## Datasets
1. **UCI Machine Learning Repository Dataset:**  
   - **Dataset Name:** Wave Energy Converters Data Set  
   - **Dataset URL:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository - Wave Energy Converters Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/494/wave+energy+converters)
   - **Code might not work because I will be using some outdated modules.

2. **Uploaded Dataset:**  
   - This dataset will be uploaded separately and contains, just the preprocessed version of previous one.

## Files
- **Data Processing Notebook:** Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, cleaning, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training Notebook:** Jupyter notebook for training machine learning models on the datasets.
- **Evaluation Notebook:** Jupyter notebook for evaluating model performance and making predictions.
- **Additional Files:** Any additional files used in the project, such as scripts, configuration files, or documentation.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:** Use the data processing notebook to prepare the datasets for model training.
2. **Model Training:** Use the model training notebook to train machine learning models on the prepared datasets.
3. **Evaluation:** Use the evaluation notebook to evaluate the performance of trained models and make predictions on new data.
